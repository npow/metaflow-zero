# Pre-commit hooks for metaflow-zero
# Install: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
#
# These hooks enforce golden principles mechanically on every commit.
# "In a human-first workflow, these rules might feel pedantic. With agents,
# they become multipliers: once encoded, they apply everywhere at once."
